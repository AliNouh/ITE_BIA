    """Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
    
    Based on my experience with feature selection, we need both accuracy and F1 score
    because accuracy alone can be misleading with imbalanced datasets. I've found that
    using 5-fold cross-validation gives more reliable results than the default 3-fold,
    especially with smaller datasets.
    
    Implementation notes:
    - Using parallel processing to speed up cross-validation
    - Added error handling for edge cases I encountered in testing
    - Returns 0.0 score for empty feature sets (learned this the hard way!)
    
    Args:
        estimator: The model to evaluate (must be sklearn-compatible)
        X: Feature matrix (samples × features)
        y: Target vector (class labels)
        feature_idx: Which features to use for evaluation
        metrics: Metrics to compute - I recommend keeping both accuracy and f1

        dict: Performance metrics and feature count for easy comparison

    4. Added feature count normalization for fair comparison

    - Chi-square requires non-negative features
